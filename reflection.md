# Reflection

## Agent Workflow

The orchestrator delegates tasks across four main agents:
1. **Inventory Agent**: Checks stock levels and provides delivery estimates.
2. **Quoting Agent**: Retrieves current pricing for items to assist in quote generation.
3. **Sales Agent**: Processes sales transactions by adjusting inventory and updating cash balances.
4. **Reporting Agent**: Generates financial summaries to evaluate business performance.

## Evaluation Summary

- **Total Orders Processed**: 19
- **Total Revenue**: $392.50
- **Final Cash Balance**: $45,059.70

### Top Selling Items
- Cardstock: 8 orders, 800 total units
- Glossy paper: 5 orders, 1000 total units
- A4 paper: 4 orders, 1050 total units

## Improvement Ideas

1. **Reinforcement Learning for Pricing**: Leverage RL to dynamically adjust pricing based on sales patterns and external market factors.

2. **Supplier API Integration**: Automate communication with suppliers through API integration to improve inventory management and order accuracy.
